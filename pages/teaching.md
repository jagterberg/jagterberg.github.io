[553.810 Probability and Statistics](../assets/RMT_notes.pdf) (Probability Theory III): This is a topics course in probability I co-led with another graduate student. (There is a mistake in the first half of these notes where I apply Weyl's inequality to a non-Hermitian matrix, but I think the argument goes through by taking real parts.)
