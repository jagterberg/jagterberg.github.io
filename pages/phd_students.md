title: Prospective PhD Students
---
<b>If you are not a PhD student at UIUC, admissions at UIUC are centralized, and I do not have control on applications.  You are, however, welcome to apply in the usual PhD application cycle.</b>

If you are a PhD student at UIUC, please read the information below, and feel free to send me an email with some of your interests.  

<b>In order to succeed in a PhD with me, you must have a strong background in mathematics and statistics.</b><br />
While you do not have to have the following background immediately upon embarking on research, the following references are most useful:
<ul>
<li>Matrix Analysis (I learned from <a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/matrix-analysis/9CF2CB491C9E97948B15FAD835EF9A8B">Horn and Johnson</a>, but I like <a href = "https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0653-8">Bhatia's</a> the best)
</li>
<li>High-dimensional probability (Vershynin's <a href = "https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html">high-dimensional probability book</a>) or statistics (Wainwright's <a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/highdimensional-statistics/8A91ECEEC38F46DAB53E9FF8757C7A4E">high-dimensional statistics book</a>)
</li>
<li>Spectral Methods for statistics (see <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08496">this monograph</a>)
</li>
<li>(Non)convex Optimization (e.g., gradient descent, KKT conditions for constrained optimization) 
</li>
<li>Asymptotic theory (at the level of Van der Vaart's <a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/asymptotic-statistics/A3C7DAD3F7E66A1FA60E9C8FE132EE1D">asymptotic statistics book</a>) 
</li>
</ul>
I recommend students interested in a PhD with me be familiar with most, if not all, of these topics by their fourth year or so (depending on research interests).  

<b>Topics of interest</b><br />
I have several topics that I am interested in, so it helps if you have a general idea of what you may be interested in working on.  Fundamentally, my research focuses on any types of high-dimensional problems with matrix and tensor data.
Potential areas of research are:
<ul>
<li>Network Asymptotics and Hypothesis Testing (see <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09828">this</a> or <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06353">this</a>) </li>
<li>Methodology for Mulilayer Networks (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05053">this</a>,<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08642">this</a>, or <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06353">this</a>) </li>
<li>Spectral methods (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05053">this</a>,<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02480">this</a>, or <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08642">this</a>)  </li>
<li>PCA/Covariance Estimation (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02480">this</a> or <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04061">this</a>)  </li>
<li>Optimization for matrices and tensors (e.g., <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08642">this</a>, but more coming soon!)  </li>
<li>Precise statistical guarantees for matrix-valued data (<a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02480">this</a> or <a href ="">this</a>, but more are coming soon!) 
</li>
</ul>
I am also open to students with ideas that may align with my interests.  I have also recently developed an interest in exact asymptotics for high-dimensional regression and classification motivated by problems in machine learning. 

Finally, I strongly believe that PhD students should learn to be <a href = "https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/checklists/aadi-talk-checklist.pdf">good speakers</a>. 
If you choose to do a PhD with me I will require that you give an informal talk (e.g., to other PhD students) once per year, and ideally 2+ talks at a conference like JSM.  I am still figuring out how to implement this logistically.
