Hello!  I am a graduate student at Johns Hopkins working on my Master's in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 
Please feel free to peruse my [github](https://github.com/jagterberg), my [cv](assets/JoshuaAgterbergCV.pdf), or my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaagterberg/).

I am broadly interested in computational statistics (see [here](/pages/compstatvsml.html) for why I do not say Machine Learning). 
Recently, I have become interested in algorithms and statistical models for networks thanks to [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/)
and his graduate Statistical Theory class. Eventually, I am hoping to work in this area for my PhD in Statistics.  

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in Actuarial
Science and Mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).
During my senior year, I started some research examining the possibilities of unsupervised learning for insurance data.
As of now, we are finishing up a [project](https://www.soa.org/pd/events/2017/predictive-analytics-symposium/pd-2017-09-predictive-analytics-session-010.pdf) involving the use of k-medoids clustering 
on survey data when variables are all categorical.  

This work has led me to develop my [catDist](https://github.com/jagterberg/catDist) R package for dissimilarity
indices when data are all or almost all categorical. Although the package is still in development, it may still
be useful for practitioners interested in k-medoids or spectral methods. My hope is that the package will be able 
to provide more context-specific dissimilarity metrics than [Gower's distance](https://www.r-bloggers.com/clustering-mixed-data-types-in-r/),
which is what is typically used within the unsupervised learning community.

Finally, in my spare time, I like to read good fantasy and play jazz piano.  In Madison, I regularly played piano with 
[The Left Field Quartet](https://leftfieldquartet.bandcamp.com/releases).
