JHU has an aggressive spam filter. If you have previously emailed me and not gotten a response, try emailing without links in the email body, or try my gmail, which is (first name last name) at gmail.

I am a PhD candidate (ABD) at Johns Hopkins in applied mathematics and statistics, advised by Professor 
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I am broadly interested in the analysis of algorithms and statistical models for networks and structured matrix and tensor data. 
You can read about some of my research [here](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/news/joshua-agterberg-best-presentation-nonparametric-statistics/) or on my research page
[here](/pages/research.html).  My research has been supported through the [Counselman Fellowship](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/fellowship-information/)
and the [MINDS Fellowship](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/people/#tripods-fellows), and I am an [AMS Teaching Fellow](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/teaching-fellows-program/).  

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).
