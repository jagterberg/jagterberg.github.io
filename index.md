Starting in August 2024 I will join the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) as tenure-track faculty. Until then, starting April 2023, I will be a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) working with [Ren√© Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html) and [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/index.html), affiliated with the [Innovation for Data Engineering and Science (IDEAS) Iniative](https://research.seas.upenn.edu/initiatives/data-science/), the [Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/), and the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). 

I defended my PhD in applied mathematics and statistics from Johns Hopkins in February 2023, entitled "[Asymptotics and Statistical Inference in High-Dimensional Low-Rank Matrix Models](/assets/dissertation.pdf)," where I was
advised by Professor [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I am broadly interested in the analysis of algorithms and statistical models for networks and structured matrix and tensor data. 
You can read about some of my research [here](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/news/joshua-agterberg-best-presentation-nonparametric-statistics/) or on my research page
[here](/pages/research.html).  My PhD research was supported through the [Counselman Fellowship](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/fellowship-information/)
and the [MINDS Fellowship](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/people/#tripods-fellows), and while at Johns Hopkins I was an [AMS Teaching Fellow](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/teaching-fellows-program/).  

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).
