Hello! I am a graduate student at Johns Hopkins working on my PhD in applied mathematics and statistics.
I am advised by Professor [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/).  I am broadly interested in algorithms 
and statistical models for networks.  You can read about my projects [here](/pages/projects.html).

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).

Finally, in my spare time, I like to read good fantasy and play jazz piano.  At UW-Madison, I regularly played piano with 
[The Left Field Quartet](https://leftfieldquartet.bandcamp.com/releases).
