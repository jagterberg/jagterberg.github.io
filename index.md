Hello! I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins in applied mathematics and statistics, advised by Professor 
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I also work with [Joshua Cape](https://pages.jh.edu/~jcape1/), 
[Minh Tang](https://minh-tang.github.io/), and [Vince Lyzinski](http://people.math.umass.edu/~lyzinski/).
I am broadly interested in algorithms and statistical models for networks and random matrices.
You can read about some of my research [here](/pages/research.html).

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).

Finally, in my spare time, I like to read good fantasy and play jazz piano.  At UW-Madison, I regularly played piano with 
[The Left Field Quartet](https://leftfieldquartet.bandcamp.com/releases).
