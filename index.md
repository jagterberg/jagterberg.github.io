[Getting to know Joshua Agterberg](https://stat.illinois.edu/news/2024-12-02t162220/faculty-profile-getting-know-joshua-agterberg)

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am broadly interested in the analysis of algorithms and statistical models for networks and structured matrix and tensor data. 
You can read about some of my research [here](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/news/agterberg-analyzes-multilayer-networks-from-airports-to-hogwarts/), [here](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/news/joshua-agterberg-best-presentation-nonparametric-statistics/), or on my research page
[here](/pages/research.html).  

Due to the large volume of emails I receive, I am unable to respond to inquiries from prospective PhD students.  PhD admissions are centralized at UIUC, so if you are interested in doing research with me, please apply directly to the PhD program in Statistics.  If you are already at UIUC, please read [this](/pages/phd_students.html).

Previously, I spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) working with [Ren√© Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html) and [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/index.html), affiliated with the [Innovation in Data Engineering and Science (IDEAS) Initiative](https://research.seas.upenn.edu/initiatives/data-science/), the [Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/), and the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). 

I defended my PhD in applied mathematics and statistics from Johns Hopkins in February 2023, entitled "[Asymptotics and Statistical Inference in High-Dimensional Low-Rank Matrix Models](/assets/dissertation.pdf)," where I was
advised by Professor [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). My PhD research was supported through the [Counselman Fellowship](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/fellowship-information/)
and the [MINDS Fellowship](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/people/#tripods-fellows), and while at Johns Hopkins I was an [AMS Teaching Fellow](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/teaching-fellows-program/).  

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).  

In my free time I enjoy trail running and lifting weights.  Ask me to run with you if you see me at a conference!
