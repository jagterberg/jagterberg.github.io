I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins in applied mathematics and statistics, advised by Professor 
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I am broadly interested in the analysis of algorithms and statistical models for networks and random matrices. 
You can read about some of my research [here](/pages/research.html).  This year, I am a [Counselman Fellow](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/fellowship-information/), and I was previously a [MINDS Fellow](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/people/#tripods-fellows).

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 with my Bachelor of Business Administration in actuarial
science and mathematics.  While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Margie Rosenberg](https://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/marjorie-rosenberg).
